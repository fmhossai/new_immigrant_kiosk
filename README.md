### Project information ðŸ“„
When new landing immigrants enter Canada, they may not know where to find the exact resources they need, such as transit or job information. In addition, when they do find the information, it is not in their native language. This project aims to create a kiosk application, that may be in areas such as airports, community centers and bus stations, that displays City of Calgary services for immigrants that are new to Calgary. It contains many essential services, such as planning a trip using Calgary Transit or finding the nearest health care services. This project displays this information in an easy to use interface with design concepts like Material design.
